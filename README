NAME
    App::sibs - Simple incremental backup system

VERSION
    0.17

DESCRIPTION
    "sibs" create backup from your computer to a destination server, using
    "rsync".

    *   Setup

        First you need to "setup" sibs. The setup process will create a SSH
        key which is uploaded to the "destination" server. The key is
        created using "ssh-keygen" and uploaded using "ssh" and "perl".

        In addition, this step will create or update a config file. The
        default config file is ".sibs.conf" in $HOME, but you can also
        specify your own path.

    *   Backup

        The second step will create the actual backup. This step can be
        automated in a cronjob, because the key created in the first step
        will not require any password to log into the remote backup server.
        Example crontab:

          0 */4 * * * /usr/local/bin/sibs backup 2>/dev/null 1>/dev/null

        This will create a backup every four hours. The backup will be
        "full" each time and kept for a month. Even so, it probably won't
        take up too much space, since all the files are hard linked, meaning
        an unchanged file will take up the same disk space for each backup.

SYNOPSIS
      $ sibs <action> <options> <config file>
      $ sibs setup
      $ sibs backup

    *   action: setup

        Used to set up the inital config file.

    *   action: backup

        Used to take backup.

    *   action: man

        Used to see this help text.

    *   options: --verbose, --silent

        Adjust log level.

    *   config file: Path to "CONFIG FILE".

CONFIG FILE
    The config file is in perl format, and read by perl. This means that any
    perl code that exists in the file will be evaluated by perl. The return
    value need to be a hash with the config. Example:

      {
        format => '%d-%H', # default
        exclude => [qw( .cache .gvfs Downloads Dropbox Trash )],
        source => [qw( /home/username )],
        destination => "rsync://login-username@my.server.com/var/backup/username",
      }

    Defaults:

    *   format: %d-%H

        The "format" will name the destination folder. See "FORMAT" in
        POSIX::strftime::GNU for details.

    *   exclude: .cache, .gvfs, Downloads, Dropbox, Trash

        Which files/directories to exclude.

    *   source: $HOME

        Which directory to backup.

    Default "exclude" may change in future release.
