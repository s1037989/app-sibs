=head1 NAME

App::sibs - Simple incremental backup system

=head1 VERSION

0.16

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<sibs> create backup from your computer to a destination server, using
C<rsync>.

=over 4

=item * Setup

First you need to C<setup> sibs. The setup process will create a SSH key
which is uploaded to the C<destination> server. The key is created using
C<ssh-keygen> and uploaded using C<ssh> and C<perl>.

In addition, this step will create or update a config file. The default
config file is L<$HOME/.sibs.conf>, but you can also specify your own path.

=item * Backup

The second step will create the actual backup. This step can be automated
in a cronjob, because the key created in the first step will not require
any password to log into the remote backup server. Example crontab:

  0 */4 * * * /usr/local/bin/sibs backup 2>/dev/null 1>/dev/null

This will create a backup every four hours. The backup will be "full" each
time and kept for a month. Even so, it probably won't take up too much space,
since all the files are hard linked, meaning an unchanged file will take up
the same disk space for each backup.

=head1 CONFIG FILE

The config file is in perl format, and read by perl. This means that any perl
code that exists in the file will be evaluated by perl. The return value need
to be a hash with the config. Example:

  {
    format => '%d-%H', # default
    exclude => [qw( .cache .gvfs Downloads Dropbox Trash )],
    source => [qw( /home/username )],
    destination => "rsync://login-username@my.server.com/var/backup/username",
  }

Defaults:

=over 4

=item * format: %d-%H

The "format" will name the destination folder. See L<POSIX::strftime::GNU/FORMAT>
for details.

=item * exclude: .cache, .gvfs, Downloads, Dropbox, Trash

Which files/directories to exclude.

=item * source: C<$HOME>

Which directory to backup.
